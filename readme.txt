Welcome to GalvBook! The idea behind this project is simple:
It will give us a space to practice our coding skills and share what we've learned with one another.
Once you're ready, make a folder in the student pages directory (.\studentPages) and add a hyperlink to the index file. 
From there feel free to make your page whatever you want! 
If you're needing some inspiration feel free to check out the code some of the other students have been writing and learn something new!
Also, if there's anything you want to add to this readme, be my guest. 

I want this project to help us get a solid understanding on how to use git and work on collaborative projects, 
so if you have something you really want to show off, throw that into the projects folder(.\projects).
Go ahead and sign in below, and let's all get smart together.
